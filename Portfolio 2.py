###Creating text for the experiment

#Introduction text
IntroText = ("Welcome to the reading experiment.\n\nPress any key to get instructions.")

#Instructions text
IntructionText =("You will now read a story word by word, carefully.\n\nWhen you have read the word presented on the screen press 'space' and a new word will be presented to you.\n\nLet's try a short story first.\n\nPress any key when you are ready.")

#Test story is defined and created as a list to be read word by word
testA = ("Somewhere out there is a girl in a bright yellow raincoat with matching boots, waiting for the bus.")
Listtest = testA.split()

#Test feedback text
TestFeed =("Great job! Now lets start the real story. Press any key to get started.")

#Creating StoryA as a list
StoryA = ("Once upon a time there lived a lion in a forest. One day after a heavy meal. It was sleeping under a tree. After a while, there came a mouse and it started to play on the lion. Suddenly the lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed its nice sleep. Then it saw a small mouse standing trembling with fear. The lion jumped on it and started to kill it. The mouse requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left it. The mouse ran away. On another day, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net. Thus it escaped. There after, the mouse and the lion became friends. They lived happily in the forest afterwards.")
ListA = StoryA.split()
 
#Creating StoryB as list (Word changed friends (-8) -> famous) 
StoryB = ("Once upon a time there lived a lion in a forest. One day after a heavy meal. It was sleeping under a tree. After a while, there came a mouse and it started to play on the lion. Suddenly the lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed its nice sleep. Then it saw a small mouse standing trembling with fear. The lion jumped on it and started to kill it. The mouse requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left it. The mouse ran away. On another day, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net. Thus it escaped. There after, the mouse and the lion became famous. They lived happily in the forest afterwards.")

#Final message text
ThankYou =("You are AWESOME! \n\nThank you for participating. \n\nPress 'any' key to quit the experiment")
