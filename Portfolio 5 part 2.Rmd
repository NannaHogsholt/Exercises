Logistic regession 
*Making the model
```{r}
m_age <- glm(Survived ~ Age, Titanic, family = binomial)
m_ageG <- glm(Survived ~ Age + Sex, Titanic, family = binomial)
m_sex <- glm(Survived ~ Sex, Titanic, family = binomial)
m_class <- glm(Survived ~ Pclass, Titanic, family = binomial)


m_max <- glm(Survived ~ Sex + Pclass + Age, Titanic, family=binomial)

```

```{r}
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(m_sex)
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(m_age)
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(m_ageG)
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(m_class)

```



```{r}
summary(m_age)
summary(m_ageG)
summary(m_sex)
summary(m_class)
summary(m_max)
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(m_max)
```



Calculating odds from the maximum model
```{r}
summary(m_max)
levels(Titanic$Survived)

#log odds into probability for estimate of intercept (**the probability of surviving given you are female, first class and minimun age?** - level 1 baseline)
boot::inv.logit(3.63492) #97%

#log odds into probability for estimate of surviving if you are male, first class and minimun age?
boot::inv.logit(3.63492 + ( -2.58872)) #74%

#log odds into probability for estimate of surviving if you are class2, female and minimum age?
boot::inv.logit(3.63492 + (-1.19911)) #91%
#log odds into probability for estimate of surviving if you are class2, male and minimum age?
boot::inv.logit(3.63492 + (-1.19911)+ ( -2.58872)) #46%

#log odds into probability for estimate of surviving if you are class3, female and female age?
boot::inv.logit(3.63492 + (-2.45544)) 

```

Calculating odds from simple models
```{r}
#FEmale
boot::inv.logit(1.0566) #74%
#The probability of surviving given that you are male
boot::inv.logit(1.0566 +  (-2.5051)) #19%

#The probability of surviving given that you are class 1
boot::inv.logit(0.5306) #62%
#The probability of surviving given that you are class 2
boot::inv.logit(0.5306 + (-0.6394)) #47%
#The probability of surviving given that you are class 3
boot::inv.logit(0.5306 + (-1.6596)) #24%

#Female age
boot::inv.logit(1.113881 +(-0.002060 * 27)) #74%
#Male age
boot::inv.logit(1.113881 - 2.500001 + (-0.002060*28)) #19%

Visualizing

#OR

#OR - however this one is very cluttered 
ggplot(Titanic, aes(Sex, Survived, color = Age, shape = Pclass)) + geom_jitter(width = .4, height = .4) + scale_color_viridis(option = "D")

```

Or this

```{r}

*Train and test

```{r}
#adding x column
Titanic <- Titanic %>% mutate(X=row_number())

#everyone with it below 30 - train data, above 30 - test data
TT_train <- subset(Titanic, X < 665) #training data
TT_test <- subset(Titanic, X > 665) #test data

#fit model to train data
trained_model <- glm(Survived ~ Sex + Pclass + Age, TT_train, family = binomial)

#predict values in test data
predicted_probs_test = predict(trained_model, TT_test, type = 'response')

#extract actual shape categories, i.e. 'true answers' from the original dataframe
actual_categories_test = TT_test$Survived

#make a dataframe to see predicted probabilities of jagged category against the actual category
pred_df_test <- tibble(predicted_probs_test, actual_categories_test)


#make a new column to see more easily what our model predicted: if probability is less than 0.5 - it predicted 'curved', otherwise - it predicted jagged
pred_df_test$predicted_category = ifelse(pred_df_test$predicted_probs_test < 0.5, "0", "1")

#let's see first 6 rows
head(pred_df_test)

#make sure predicted category is a factor (at the moment it's a character variable due to the way we specified ifelse outcomes)
pred_df_test$predicted_category <- as_factor(pred_df_test$predicted_category)

#make the confusion matrix
confusionMatrix(pred_df_test$predicted_category, pred_df_test$actual_categories_test, positive ="1")

DVS. 80% accuracy
sensitivity: 67% of the people predicted to be dead were actually dead
Specificity: 86% of the people predicted to be alive were actually alive
